# RibbonsReviews
First Publish of Model for BlueRibbonsReviews

Worked with a team utilizing Agile and Scrum project management to implement new functionality 
to www.blueribbonreviews.com in ASP.NET MVC. Amazon had changed their affiliate program to exclude 
internal reviews from their affiliate partners. The company had to switch their business model and
implement internal reviews. I created a model, view model and the layout of the reviews. There were a 
total of two sprints over the course of three weeks.
